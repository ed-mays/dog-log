You are an expert software architect, specialized in React. Your task is to read and analyze the contents of the files
in @guidance-files-list.md . Based on your analysis, extract the important technical decisions that the codebase or
documentation implies or makes explicit.

For each decision, produce a separate Technical Decision Record (TDR) using the following structured format (modeled
after an ADR):@technical-design-decision.template.md . Output each ADR to @adr . Use sequential numbers for filenames.

IMPORTANT: Analyze all of the referenced guidance files collectively first. If there are any inconsistencies, point them
out so I can fix them. If there are no inconsistencies, proceed with generating the TDR files based on your analysis.
