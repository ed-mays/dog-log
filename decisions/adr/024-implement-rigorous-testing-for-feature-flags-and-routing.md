TITLE: Implement Rigorous Testing for Feature Flags and Routing

STATUS: Accepted
DATE: 2025-11-01

CONTEXT:
Our current test suite does not adequately cover the various states of our feature flags and routing logic. We have gaps in testing key scenarios, such as UI elements that should be hidden when a flag is disabled, redirection from routes gated by flags, unauthenticated access to protected routes, and the handling of unknown (404) routes. This lack of coverage creates a risk of deploying features with broken access control or exposing incomplete functionality.

DECISION:
We will implement comprehensive and rigorous tests for all feature flag and routing logic. All new features and refactors must include tests covering the following scenarios:

1.  **UI Gating:** For every feature flag that conditionally renders a UI element (e.g., a button, link, or menu item), a test must be added to assert that the element is **not** rendered or is disabled when the flag is `false`.
2.  **Route Gating:** For every route controlled by a feature flag, a test must assert that attempting to navigate to that route correctly redirects the user or displays a "Feature Unavailable" page when the flag is `false`.
3.  **Authentication and Authorization:** All protected routes must have tests that verify unauthenticated users are redirected to the appropriate login or welcome page.
4.  **404/Not Found Handling:** A dedicated test will be created to navigate to a non-existent URL and assert that the application displays the correct 404 "Not Found" page.

These tests will primarily be implemented as integration-style tests within our Vitest setup, using our custom `render` utility to control feature flag states and initial routes.

CONSEQUENCES:

- **Positive:**
  - Significantly increases confidence that our feature flagging system works as intended.
  - Prevents the accidental release of incomplete or broken features.
  - Ensures application routing and access control are robust and predictable.
  - Provides clear documentation of expected behavior for different application states.
- **Negative:**
  - Increases the total number of tests to be written and maintained for each feature.

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED:

- **Relying on manual testing:** This was rejected as it is not scalable, is prone to human error, and fails to provide the rapid feedback required during development and CI.
- **Only testing the "happy path" (flags enabled):** This was rejected because it completely ignores the critical off-state and edge cases, which are common sources of bugs.
