TITLE: Adopt Material Design Ecosystem for UI

STATUS: Accepted
DATE: 2025-10-31

CONTEXT:
The Dog Log app requires a modern, consistent, and accessible UI framework to accelerate development and maintain design
coherence. The team evaluated several UI libraries compatible with React 19, TypeScript (strict), and Vite.

DECISION:
Adopt the Material Design ecosystem (Material UI for React) as the foundation for all UI components and design patterns.

CONSEQUENCES:

- **Consistency:** All UI elements will follow Material Design guidelines, improving visual and interaction consistency.
- **Development Speed:** Material UI provides a rich set of pre-built, customizable components, reducing custom UI code.
- **Accessibility:** Material UI components support ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation.
- **Theming:** Use Material UI's ThemeProvider for dark/light modes and branding.
- **Community Support:** Material UI is widely adopted, well-documented, and actively maintained.
- **Integration:** Material UI integrates smoothly with React 19, TypeScript (strict), and Vite.
- **Testing:** UI tests will use Testing Library conventions, focusing on accessible queries and avoiding snapshot
  tests.

**Implementation Notes:**

- All new UI components should use Material UI primitives unless a business case for custom styling is documented.
- Theming and customization managed via Material UI's ThemeProvider.
- Accessibility and testing guidelines from repo conventions remain in effect.

**Verification:**
After migration or new component development, verify with:

- `npm run build`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test`

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED:

- **Chakra UI:** Good accessibility and theming, but less mature ecosystem and fewer advanced components.
- **Ant Design:** Comprehensive, but less flexible theming and heavier bundle size.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first, but requires more custom component work and less out-of-the-box accessibility.
