TITLE: Code Formatting and Linting with Prettier and ESLint

STATUS: Accepted
DATE: 2025-10-31

CONTEXT:
To maintain a high level of code quality and consistency, especially in a team environment, automated tools for
enforcing code style and identifying potential bugs are essential.

DECISION:
We will use a combination of two tools:

1. **Prettier**: An opinionated code formatter that will be used to automatically format the entire codebase, ensuring a
   consistent style.
2. **ESLint**: A static analysis tool that will be used to identify and report on problematic patterns, enforce best
   practices (e.g., accessibility, React hooks rules), and prevent common bugs.
   These tools will be integrated into the development workflow and CI/CD pipeline.

CONSEQUENCES:

- **Positive**:
  - Automates the process of code formatting, eliminating debates about style and saving developer time.
  - Catches a wide range of potential bugs and anti-patterns before they make it into production.
  - Enforces a consistent and readable codebase, making it easier to onboard new developers.
- **Negative**:
  - Initial setup and configuration can be complex.
  - Can sometimes be overly strict, requiring developers to write disable-comments for valid edge cases.

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED:

- **Using only ESLint for formatting**: While ESLint has formatting rules, Prettier is purpose-built for formatting and
  generally does a better, more consistent job.
- **No automated tooling**: This would lead to an inconsistent and lower-quality codebase that is harder to maintain
  over time.
