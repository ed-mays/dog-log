TITLE: Use TypeScript for Type Safety

STATUS: Accepted
DATE: 2025-10-31

CONTEXT:
JavaScript, being a dynamically typed language, can lead to runtime errors that are difficult to catch during
development. The project needs a way to enforce type safety to improve code quality, maintainability, and developer
confidence.

DECISION:
We will use TypeScript for all new application code. A strict TypeScript configuration will be enforced to catch as many
potential errors as possible at compile time. All new files should use the `.tsx` extension.

CONSEQUENCES:

- **Positive**:
  - Catches type-related errors during development, reducing runtime bugs.
  - Improves code readability and self-documentation through explicit types.
  - Enhances IDE support with better autocompletion and code navigation.
  - Facilitates safer refactoring.
- **Negative**:
  - Adds a compilation step to the development process.
  - Can have a learning curve for developers new to static types.
  - May require more verbose code compared to plain JavaScript.

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED:

- **JavaScript with JSDoc**: Provides some type-checking capabilities but is less powerful and not as well-integrated
  into the ecosystem as TypeScript.
- **Flow**: A static type checker for JavaScript developed by Facebook. While similar to TypeScript, it has a much
  smaller community and is less widely adopted.
