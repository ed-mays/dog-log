### The Core Problem: Conflicting Alias Patterns

The test failures are caused by two different import alias patterns being used inconsistently throughout the project:

1.  **Pattern 1:
 `@/alias/*`** (e.g., `@/firebase`, `@/services/*`)
2.  **Pattern 2: `@alias/*`** (e.g., `@components/*`, `@store/*`)

My previous attempt to fix an issue with `@services` involved changing its definition to
 `@services/*` in `tsconfig.json`, which conflicted with the `@/services/*` definition used in `tsconfig.app.json` and `vitest.config.ts`. This created more inconsistencies.

### Key Configuration Files

The aliases are defined in three main places. The settings in `vitest.config
.ts` are the most critical for resolving the test failures, as they directly configure the test environment's module resolver.

1.  **`vitest.config.ts`**: Defines aliases in a `resolve.alias` object. This is where the test runner's resolver is configured. It also
 uses the `vite-tsconfig-paths` plugin, which reads aliases from a `tsconfig` file.
2.  **`tsconfig.app.json`**: Contains `compilerOptions.paths` used by the `vite-tsconfig-paths` plugin. This file has a mix of both `@/` and `@` alias
 patterns.
3.  **`tsconfig.json`**: The root config, which also contains `compilerOptions.paths`. This is used for project-wide settings and is often what the IDE uses for path resolution.

### How the Failures Manifest

The latest test output in `@test-output.json` shows that
 the test runner cannot resolve imports because of this mismatch. For example, you will see errors like:

*   `Failed to resolve import "@services/petService" from "src/store/pets.store.tsx"`

This happens because the configuration files define the alias as `@/services/*`, but the import
 statement in the code is missing the slash. The reverse is also true for other aliases.

### Path to Resolution

To resolve this, you will need to:

1.  **Choose a single, consistent alias pattern.** The `@/alias/*` pattern is slightly more common in the existing configuration.
2.
  **Update all three configuration files** (`vitest.config.ts`, `tsconfig.app.json`, and `tsconfig.json`) to use only the chosen pattern for all aliases.
3.  **Update the import statements** in the source (`.tsx` and `.ts`) files to match the
 newly standardized alias pattern. This will likely require a project-wide find-and-replace for each alias that is changed.
