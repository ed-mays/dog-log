# User Story

As an application user
I want a navigation bar in the application
So that I can easily navigate to different areas of the application

# Technical Guidance

- The Navigation Bar should be based on the MUI AppBar component

### Acceptance Criteria for Navigation Bar

Here is a summary of the acceptance criteria derived from the feature plan, which can be used to validate the final
implementation.

#### **Functional Criteria**

- **AC1: Fixed Position:** The navigation bar must be implemented using Material-UI's `AppBar` and `Toolbar` components
  and remain fixed at the top of the viewport as the user scrolls.
- **AC2: Brand Identity and Navigation:**
- The brand name "Dog Log" must be displayed.
- A `Pets` icon must be displayed next to the brand name.
- The entire brand area (icon and text) must function as a single link that navigates the user to the homepage (`/`).
- **AC3: "Pets" Page Link:** A clearly labeled link with the text "Pets" must be present in the navigation bar, which
  navigates the user to the `/pets` page.
- **AC4: Logout Functionality:** The existing `LogoutButton` component must be included and rendered within the
  navigation bar, providing users with a way to sign out.

#### **Accessibility Criteria**

- **AC5: Navigational Role:** The `AppBar` must have the WAI-ARIA `role="navigation"` and an accessible name of "
  Primary" (e.g., via `aria-label="Primary"`) to be properly identified by screen readers.
- **AC6: Brand as Heading:** The brand name "Dog Log" must be semantically identifiable as a heading (e.g., `<h1>`).
- **AC7: Keyboard Navigable:** All interactive elements, including the brand link, "Pets" link, and the logout button,
  must be visible, focusable, and operable using only a keyboard.

#### **Non-Functional & Technical Criteria**

- **AC8: Test Coverage:** The component must be fully tested following the TDD plan, with tests covering rendering,
  navigation links, and the inclusion of the logout button. All tests must pass.
- **AC9: Internationalization Readiness:** All user-facing strings (e.g., "Dog Log", "Pets") should be prepared for
  future internationalization, as outlined in the project guidelines. The initial implementation can use constants as a
  first step.
- **AC10: Code Quality:** The implementation must adhere to the project's linting and formatting rules, with
  `npm run lint` and `npm run format` passing without errors.
