# Gemini Code Improvement Plan

This document outlines a step-by-step plan to improve the codebase of the dog-log application.

### Step 1: Refactor `App.tsx` for Better Readability and Maintainability (Completed)

The `App.tsx` file contained several components and logic that have been extracted into separate files to improve
readability and maintainability.

- **Extracted `PrivateRoute`:** The `PrivateRoute` component was moved to its own file inside
  `src/components/common/PrivateRoute.tsx`.
- **Extracted `RoutePrefetcher`:** The `RoutePrefetcher` component was moved to its own file at
  `src/features/petManagement/RoutePrefetcher.tsx`.
- **Extracted `AppRoutes`:** The routing logic from the main `App` component was extracted into a separate `AppRoutes`
  component in `src/AppRoutes.tsx`.

### Step 2: Improve State Management (Completed)

The application's state management with Zustand was optimized.

- **Optimized Selectors:** The `usePetsStore` hook in `RoutePrefetcher` was optimized by using a single selector with
  `shallow` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Consolidated UI State:** Global UI state like `loading` and `error` was moved from `pets.store.ts` into a dedicated
  `ui.store.ts` for better separation of concerns.

### Step 3: Enhance Testing Strategy (In Progress)

The project's testing strategy is being improved to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

- **Fix Failing Tests:** All existing unit tests were diagnosed and fixed after the major refactoring in steps 1 and 2.
- **Add Unit Tests:** New unit tests were added for the extracted components (`PrivateRoute`, `RoutePrefetcher`,
  `AppRoutes`).
- **Add Integration Tests:** An integration test for the "add a new pet" user flow was created to test the interaction
  between multiple components.

### Step 4: Styling and CSS Improvements

The current CSS implementation can be improved for better maintainability and scalability.

- **Adopt a CSS-in-JS solution:** Consider using a library like Emotion or styled-components to colocate styles with
  components.
- **Introduce a Theme and Design System:** Establish a consistent design system and theme to be used across the
  application.

### Step 5: Update Dependencies

Project dependencies should be audited and updated to ensure security and performance.

- **Audit Dependencies:** Use `npm audit` to identify and fix security vulnerabilities.
- **Update Major Versions:** Plan for updating major versions of key dependencies like React, Vite, and TypeScript.
